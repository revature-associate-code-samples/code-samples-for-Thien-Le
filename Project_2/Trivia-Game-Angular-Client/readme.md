 Project 2 - Trivia Townes

  Trivia Townes provides a real-time, competitive multiplayer trivia experience. Users have the ability to join existing game lobbies or create a custom game lobby. Created lobbies can then be found by other users on the server lobby page. Upon joining an existing lobby, users are redirected to a communal waiting page until the game begins. Players are scored according to accuracy and speed. After the game ends, scores are persisted to a database. Users then have the ability to view the global leaderboard.
