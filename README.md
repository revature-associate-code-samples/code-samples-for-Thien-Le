## Project 0 - Java CLI Banking Application
This application allows users to create a bank account and interact with that account through the command line. Users are able to deposit, withdraw, and check funds in their account. The application includes validation for usernames, emails, and more. Users are able to log in to and out of their accounts, maintaining session state via file IO and the singleton design pattern.

## Project 1 - Full-Stack Java Employee Reimbursement Application
The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can login and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement.

## Project 2 - Trivia Townes
Trivia Townes provides a real-time, competitive multiplayer trivia experience. Users have the ability to join existing game lobbies or create a custom game lobby. Created lobbies can then be found by other users on the server lobby page. Upon joining an existing lobby, users are redirected to a communal waiting page until the game begins. Players are scored according to accuracy and speed. After the game ends, scores are persisted to a database. Users then have the ability to view the global leaderboard.

My primary roles in this project involved working mostly with back-end application and adding some functionalities to the front-end.

## Project 3 - Caliber
Caliber is a performance management suite to collect and analyze evaluations of Revature trainees. Trainers can input grades and feedback for each of their trainees. The quality department can input their evaluations on the batch of trainees. Trainers and quality personnel can comment on a trainee's profile. The Caliber suite also provides a variety of reports on different levels of granularity using visual dashboards and tabular data. Users can generate individual and batch PDF reports to distribute to clients, trainees, and other stakeholders.

In this project, i was resposible for working extensively with the back-end application and the microservice ecosystem.
