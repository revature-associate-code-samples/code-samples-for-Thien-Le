 # Project 2 - Trivia Townes

 Angular/Front-end: https://github.com/revature-associate-code-samples/code-samples-for-Thien-Le/tree/master/Project2/Trivia-Game-Angular-Client
 
  Trivia Townes provides a real-time, competitive multiplayer trivia experience. Users have the ability to join existing game lobbies or create a custom game lobby. Created lobbies can then be found by other users on the server lobby page. Upon joining an existing lobby, users are redirected to a communal waiting page until the game begins. Players are scored according to accuracy and speed. After the game ends, scores are persisted to a database. Users then have the ability to view the global leaderboard.
  
  My primary roles in this project involved working extensively with our back-end application and some of front-end.
  
  For back-end, I handled the retrieval of api data.  I created a some classes that map the JSON objects i got from the api. 
  
  For the client-side/front-end of the application, I used Angular to create a single page application. Using TypeScript to add populate players on the waiting page. Also, i wrote various databinding and DOM manipulation tasks.
