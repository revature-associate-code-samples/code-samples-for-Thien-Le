# Project3-Caliber Performance Management Suite

Caliber is a performance management suite used to collect and analyze evaluations of Revature trainees with the goal of increasing transparency, fostering informed decision making, and creating actionable information. Caliber takes input for any quality checkpoint from the beginning to the end of the associate lifecycle (screening, training, QC, panel, etc). The Caliber suite also provides a variety of reports on different levels of granularity using visual dashboards and tabular data. Users can generate individual and batch PDF reports to distribute to clients, trainees, and other stakeholders.
